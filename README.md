# Python OpenWeather-API calls

U of R Data Science Bootcamp - OpenWeather-API call project. 

## 3 Trends

1. The further from the equator, the colder the temperature.
2. Minor effect of increased windspeeds further from the equator
3. Cloudiness is disbursed evenly across all latitudes

### Notes

The default for the temperature for OpenWeather is Kelvin. You must include the following in the API call for imperial/US measure.

```
"&units=imperial"
```
